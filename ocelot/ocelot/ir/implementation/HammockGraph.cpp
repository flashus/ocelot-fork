/*
1) Do no consider any edges that leave or entry the hammock.

2) Attempt a topological sort. This is done by starting with the entry
node, adding all successors to a set, then picking the next node to
schedule from the successor set such that all of it's predecessors are
either not contained in the hammock, or are already scheduled.

3) If the sort fails, there is a cycle that ends with at least one node
in the successor set.  Discover the cycle and remove all edges that
cycle exit the cycle.  This can be accomplished by performing a
traversal starting from each node in the successor list. If the
traversal ever ends with the starting node, then there is a cycle ending
in that node.  Ignore the edge that completes the cycle. Resume the
topological sort.

Consider the following example:

A -> B
A -> C
B -> D
C -> D
C -> E
D -> F
E -> C
E -> F

This algorithm could produce the following schedules:

1) A, B, C, D, E, F
2) A, B, C, E, D, F

In these cases, 2) has the potential to be faster than 1) because the
node E that is part of the cycle C -> E -> C is given priority over D.
So if threads iterate over the cycle multiple times then some threads
could be peeled off on every iteration and branch to D.  Schedule 1)
would push these one at a time to F, while schedule 2) would accumulate
them at D and then push them to F all at once.  This leads me to another
rule of thumb: during scheduling, nodes that are part of a cycle should
be given scheduling priority over nodes that are not.

So let me modify the algorithm as follows:

1) Do no consider any edges that leave or entry the hammock.

2) Attempt a topological sort.  Stop if the sort fails.

3) Detect a cycle as follows.  For ever node in the successor set,
compute the set of predecessor nodes that are reachable from in-edges
that have not been scheduled as well as the set of successor nodes that
are reachable through out-edges and have not been scheduled.  The
intersection of these two sets is a new set of nodes that form a cycle.
  Set a cycle bit for these nodes and remove edges from this set of
nodes that end in the node being considered.  Resume the topological
sort, giving priority to nodes with the cycle bit set if there is a choice.

This forces the algorithm to always select:

1) A, B, C, E, D, F

Note that it is still not optimal in cases where there are multiple
interacting loops because the iteration count for each loop is not
known.  If we had profiling information, we could give priority to nodes
that are part of loops that exit the loop frequently.
