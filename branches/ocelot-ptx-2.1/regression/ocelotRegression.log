Name : TestParser

Description: A test for the PTXParser class. Test Points: 1) Load a PTX file 
             and run it through the parser generating a module. Write the 
             module to an intermediate stream. Parse the stream again 
             generating a new module, compare both to make sure that they match.

             instruction's toString method, make sure that these pass the valid() 
             check, compare to references from the LLVM manual.

Name : TestDeviceSwitching

Description: A unit test for the ability of the CUDA runtime to switch 
             between devices and use multiple threads Test Points: 1) In a single 
             threaded application, iterate across all devices launching the same 
             simple kernel each time 2) Test context migration support in 
             ocelot. Iterate across all devices, launching a simple kernel that 
             updates shared variable. Use the context switch mechanism to 
             migrate the shared data. 3) Test multi-threading support. Launch one 
             host thread to allocate memory, pass pointers to worker 
             threads, each of which should launch independent kernels in 
             parallel.

Name : TestDataflowGraph

Description: A test for the DataflowGraph class. Test Points: 1) 
             Generic: load PTX files, convert them into dataflow graphs, verify that 
             all live ranges spanning blocks are consistent. 2) SSA: convert to 
             ssa form, verify that no register is declared more than once. 3) 
             reverse SSA: convert to ssa then out of ssa, verify that all live 
             ranges spanning blocks are consistent.
